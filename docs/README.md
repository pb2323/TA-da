# Docs

Design, architecture, and runbooks for TA-DA.

## Contents

- **Architecture** — End-to-end flow: Zoom → Backend → Elastic / Fetch.ai / Perplexity / HeyGen
- **Demo script** — 2-minute TreeHacks demo (see root [README](../README.md#demo-script-2-minute-flow))
- **Sponsor alignment** — How each sponsor's tech is used (see root [README](../README.md#sponsor-alignment))

## Vision

TA-DA turns Zoom into a **Learning Operations System**: a closed-loop intelligence layer for real-time education, not just notes or summaries.
